# Google-Dorks-to-find-private-bug-bounty-programs
If you're asking **"how to use Google Dorks to find private bug bounty programs"**, let me clarify:

> ⚠️ **There is no legal or ethical way to use Google Dorking to access *private* bug bounty programs.**
> Private programs are meant to be hidden and **accessible only via invitation**. Trying to uncover or access them without permission is **unethical** and may be **illegal**.

---

However, what you *can* do — and what many ethical hackers do — is **use Google Dorking to find public disclosure pages, misconfigured scopes, or self-hosted bounty programs** that are *intended* to be found. These are not *private*, but they may be **less visible** than big public platforms.

Here are some **ethical and legal Google Dorks** you can try:

---

### 🔍 Useful Google Dorks for Finding Bounty Targets (Legal Use)

#### 🟢 1. **Find security policies / disclosure programs:**

```bash
inurl:security.txt
inurl:.well-known/security.txt
intitle:"responsible disclosure program"
intitle:"bug bounty program"
"bug bounty" site:*.com
```

#### 🟢 2. **Find GitHub or Pastebin scopes:**

```bash
site:github.com "bug bounty scope"
site:pastebin.com "bug bounty scope"
site:github.com intext:"vulnerability disclosure"
```

#### 🟢 3. **Find PDFs or docs from companies listing security info:**

```bash
intitle:"bug bounty" filetype:pdf
intext:"vulnerability disclosure" filetype:pdf
inurl:bug-bounty-policy filetype:pdf
```

#### 🟢 4. **Find bug bounty programs from startup or self-hosted sites:**

```bash
"security researcher reward" site:*.tech
"bug bounty" site:*.xyz
```

---

### 🎯 Bonus: Find Companies Likely Running a Program

Even if they don't advertise it, you can check if companies publish security info:

```bash
inurl:security.txt site:companyname.com
```

If they have `security.txt`, they likely welcome responsible disclosure, even if they don't have a public bounty.

### ❌ Don’t Try to:

* Dork for hidden HackerOne or Bugcrowd invite-only links
  *(those URLs are protected & private by design — forcing access is unethical)*
* Use dorks to find confidential company information
  *(e.g. login pages, admin panels, or internal bug reports outside scope)*

---

### ✅ What to Do Instead:

* Build trust on public programs (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, etc.)
* Score high-quality reports → get invited to private programs
* Monitor HackerOne’s [Disclosure](https://hackerone.com/disclosed) page to learn patterns
* Practice on public assets and CTFs

If you'd like, I can give you a **custom list of dorks for specific industries or targets** (e.g., fintech, healthcare, startups). Just tell me your goal.
